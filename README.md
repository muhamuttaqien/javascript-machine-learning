# javascript-machine-learning
Machine Learning with JavaScript using two popular algorithms including linear-regression and k-nearest neighbor.

I'm done with these steps:

1. Install the libraries including ml-regression, ml-knn, csvtojson and prompt
2. Initialize the libraries and load the data
3. Dress the data to get it ready for execution
4. Train its model and start predicting

I executed the index.js inside linear-regression folder to train my first Linear Regression Model in javascript as well as K-nearest Neighbor model inside knn folder. Feel welcomed to node it!
